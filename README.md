# About
Ultimate Helper is a simple 'extension' to restore every licence of JetBrains and could have free licence for EVER!

# Warning
This 'extension' for the moment is currently ONLY working in Linux 'cause this was created and 
developed in .bat file (Shell) and cannot be replicated in Linux (and i don't have time to do it xD)
