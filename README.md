# About
Ultimate Helper is a simple 'extension' to restore every licence of JetBrains and could have free licence for **EVER**!

# Warning
This 'extension' for the moment is currently **ONLY** working in Linux 'cause this was created and 
developed in .bat file (Shell) and cannot be replicated in Linux (and i don't have time to do it xD)

# Usage
How do i use this thing? Easy, you only have to download the resource in the **RELEASES** section.
When you have the the resource just follow the steps.

 . Open the WinRar archive and drag the folder in to your desktop (or do right click in the WinRar archive and select 'Extract here')
 . Right now i have the folder in your desktop and now? Just open the folder and select the file called 'ultimate-helper.bat'
 . Now the ULTIMATE HELPER will open the terminal and automatically do everything, just wait (this only take a few seconds)
 . A alert will appear (telling you the credits), then you just close that alert and push any key of you keyboard to close the terminal
 . And that's all! You have JetBrain products for ever!
