# About
Ultimate Helper is a simple 'extension' to restore every licence of JetBrains and could have free licence for **EVER**!

# Warning
This 'extension' for the moment is currently **ONLY** working in Linux 'cause this was created and 
developed in .bat file (Shell) and cannot be replicated in Linux (and i don't have time to do it xD)

# Usage
How do i use this thing? Easy, you only have to download the resource in the **RELEASES** section.
When you have the the resource just follow the steps.

 1. Open the WinRar archive and drag the folder in to your desktop (or do right click in the WinRar archive and select 'Extract here')
 2. Right now i have the folder in your desktop and now? Just open the folder and select the file called 'ultimate-helper.bat'
 3. Now the ULTIMATE HELPER will open the terminal and automatically do everything, just wait (this only take a few seconds)
 4. A alert will appear (telling you the credits), then you just close that alert and push any key of you keyboard to close the terminal
 5. And that's all! You have JetBrain products for ever!
